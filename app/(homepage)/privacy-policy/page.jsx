                1. How this policy works
            </h3>
            <p className='my-3'>
                This Privacy Policy applies to the collection, use, disclosure and handling of Personal Information by Dovetail Research Pty. Ltd. and its related entities (“we”, “us”, or “Dovetail”), including information collected via dovetail.com (our “website”), product pages, mobile and/or web applications (collectively, the “Services”).
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                As Dovetail Research Pty Ltd is an Australian business, this Privacy Policy takes into account the requirements of the Australian Privacy Principles set out in the Australian Privacy Act, as well as other applicable privacy laws.
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given to those terms in our Master Subscription Agreement.
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                Your privacy is very important to us, and we encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. By providing Personal Information to us, you consent to our collection, handling, use and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we are not able to collect certain Personal Information about you, this may limit your ability to use or access the Services.
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                This Policy does not apply to websites, apps, products, or services that we do not own or control. Further, where our Services are made available to you via an organization (for example, where your employer is our Customer and has made you an Authorized User of the Services under our contract with them), that organization will control the information processed via the Services, including Customer Data. This means that this Privacy Policy will not apply to that information, and Dovetail will not be responsible for the privacy practices of that organization. Rather, your information will be subject to that organization’s practices, policies, and collection notices. We encourage you to review these materials as they relate to the handling of your information.

                4. How we share information we collect
            </h3>
            <p className='my-3'>
                We share information we collect in the ways set out below, including in connection with possible business transfers. We do not sell information about you to advertisers or other third parties.
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                Sharing with other users<br />
                Dovetail is collaborative cloud product built for teams. This means sharing information with others through the Services, and with certain third parties. For example, your profile information or content you upload to the Services may be shared with other members of your workspace or the Customer administering your workspace. These people are usually colleagues you work with day-to-day, or clients you have added to your workspace.
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                Sharing with third parties<br />
                In addition to the specific circumstances discussed elsewhere in this policy, we may share Personal Information:
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                with our corporate affiliates and subsidiaries;
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                with third parties performing services to support our core business functions and internal operations;

            </p><p className='my-3'>
                in connection with a change of ownership or control of all or part of our business (such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or bankruptcy);
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                with credit reporting agencies and courts, tribunals and regulatory authorities where you fail to pay for goods or services provided to you;
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to detect or protect against fraud or security issues;
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                if otherwise required or permitted by applicable law or regulation, including laws and regulations of Australia and other countries, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with a legal obligation or in response to a request from law enforcement or other public authorities wherever we may do business; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our users, customers, and contractors/employees; or (d) enforce our legal terms or otherwise protect against any legal liability; and

                14. Legal bases for processing (for EEA users)
            </h3>
            <p className='my-3'>
                Where we are deemed a data controller under applicable privacy laws of the European Economic Area (EEA) and if you are an individual in EEA, we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases may depend on the Services you use and how you use them, such as the following:
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                we need your information to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                our collection and use of your information satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                you give us consent to collect and/or use your information for a specific purpose; or
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                we need to process your information to comply with a legal obligation.
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, when processing the Personal Information of Authorized Users in connection with the provision of Services to our Customers, we may be deemed a ‘data processor’ while our Customers are deemed ‘data controllers’. Where we are deemed a data processor, we rely on our Customer, the data controller, to ascertain they have legitimate bases to authorize our processing of Customer Data. Authorized Users should contact our Customer, the data controller, to withdraw consent, object to processing, or pursue any legal data subject rights.
            </p><p className='my-3'>
                Where we are using your information because we or a Customer (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, and you object to such use, then, in some cases, this may mean no longer being able to access or use the Services.
